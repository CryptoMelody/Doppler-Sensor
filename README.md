# Doppler-Sensor

This project and others was made a long time ago, so that's why some of the **projects doesn't have any connections!!!!!!**NOW I WILL UPLOAD ALL MY WORKS ONLY ON GITHUB AND THEY WILL INCLUDE ALL INFORMATION!


Doppler sensor is the best module to detect some kind of the movements. It can detect it through the wood, plastics etc. But cannot get through the metal or the concrete.
